Note: If there are no adjacent student then the student name should stay the same.

--Table Structure:

drop table students;
create table students
(
id int primary key,
student_name varchar(50) not null
);
insert into students values
(1, 'James'),
(2, 'Michael'),
(3, 'George'),
(4, 'Stewart'),
(5, 'Robin');


solution 1:
------------------
select id,student_name,
case when id%2 <> 0 then lead(student_name,1,student_name) over(order by id)
when id%2 = 0 then lag(student_name) over(order by id) end as new_student_name
from students;

solution 2 :
----------------

select * ,
case when id % 2 <> 0 and lead(student_name) over(order by id) is null
	then student_name
    when id % 2 <> 0 and lead(student_name) over(order by id) is not null
	then lead(student_name) over(order by id)
    else lag(student_name) over (order by id)
END  as event_student
from students;
